# 🚗 Self-Driving Car Simulation

This project simulates a self-driving car using advanced design patterns, including State, Strategy, Observer, and Singleton. It provides a structured approach to autonomous vehicle behavior simulation, making it an excellent reference for software engineers interested in object-oriented programming (OOP) and design patterns.

## 🌟 Features

State Pattern: Manages different states of the car (e.g., driving, stopping, parking).

Strategy Pattern: Implements multiple driving strategies (e.g., aggressive, defensive).

Observer Pattern: Enables event-driven responses in the simulation.

Singleton Pattern: Ensures a single instance of critical components like the traffic system.

Realistic Simulation: Simulates road conditions, traffic rules, and dynamic interactions.


## 🛠 Technologies Used

Programming Language: Java / Python (Specify the main language used)

Design Patterns: State, Strategy, Observer, Singleton

Frameworks/Libraries: (Mention any additional dependencies if applicable)
